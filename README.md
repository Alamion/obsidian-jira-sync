# Obsidian Jira Plugin

A lightweight plugin for Obsidian that syncs your Jira issues directly into your vault. Manage Jira tasks, update statuses, log work, and more â€” all within Obsidian.

Based on work [obsidian-to-jira](https://github.com/angelperezasenjo/obsidian-to-jira)

## Key Features

- **Sync Jira Issues**: Import, update, and create Jira issues directly in Obsidian.
- **Flexible Templates**: Supports custom templates with dynamic fields for most basic and custom fields.
- **Status & Worklog Updates**: Pull possible statuses and log work directly from notes.

## Quick Start

1. **Install**: Go to Obsidian Settings > Community plugins > Browse, and search for "Jira Issue Manager" 
2. **Configure**: Enter your Jira credentials (username, password, URL) in the plugin settings.
3. **Use**:
	- **Import Issues**: Update the current note or pull new issue from Jira by its key.
	- **Update Issues**: Edit issue notes and push changes back to Jira.
	- **Create Issues**: Write a note with frontmatter (e.g., `summary: "Your issue summary"`) and use the command palette to create it in Jira.

## Template Example

Create dynamic templates with fields like this:

```
### Description  
`jira-sync-section-description`
It's the multiline field.
It can hold several lines.
Until it's stopped by '# ' or other jira field

### Users
`jira-sync-line-assignee` user1
`jira-sync-line-reporter` user2
`jira-sync-line-creator` user3
```

## Advanced Features

- **Worklog Tracking**: Use `/docs/statistics.md` file from github (or write your own with similar frontmatter output) to track worklogs and push them for entire weeks.
- **Field Mapping**: Smart mapping for any field from Jira to your note and vice versa. Decide it to be synced or not and how exactly.
